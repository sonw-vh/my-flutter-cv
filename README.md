# 🔥 flutter_cv 🔥

When deadline comes, everything goes sucks. But this is my CV anyway ✨

## How to run it 🏃

This is the web version of it: https://cv-sonwday.web.app/.

But for best experience, plug-in a mobile device and turn on Command Prompt:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sonw-vh/my-flutter-cv.git
cd my-flutter-cv
flutter run
```
or [Download .apk file of my CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D_aEfo1Xvk2yLNHNOFYdMCCSrwgHEmdz/view?usp=share_link)

## Please use the second way 💪😔 I wrote an app, not a web 📱
"# my-flutter-cv"
